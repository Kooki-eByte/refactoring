# refactoring
Week one project

- This project was made to refactor a html and css file to the point of being as semantic as possible.

- Give a look at how the industry wants their html to look like as much as possible with semantic html tags, such as <header>, <nav>, <footer>, etc...

- Simple yet very effective to allow things like GoogleBot and BingBot to see your code and know exactly what it is due to the semantic style that it likes to see.
